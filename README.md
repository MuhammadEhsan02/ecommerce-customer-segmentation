# Predictive Modeling on Customer Segmentation in E-Commerce

This repository is dedicated to my final year project, "**Predictive Modeling on Customer Segmentation in E-Commerce**," which was conducted as part of the UGD in Artificial Intelligence at NED University of Engineering and Technology.

## Project Overview

The objective of this project is to segment customers within an e-commerce environment based on their purchasing behavior using a combination of machine learning models and natural language processing (NLP) techniques. This project addresses a critical business need by enabling the identification of key factors influencing customer satisfaction and predicting customer review ratings. These insights can be leveraged by businesses to optimize their marketing strategies and enhance overall customer experience.

### Key Features:

1. **Comprehensive Analysis**:
   - A detailed exploration of customer behavior through data cleaning, feature engineering, and exploratory data analysis (EDA).

2. **Predictive Modeling**:
   - Implementation of various machine learning algorithms including Logistic Regression, K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Decision Trees, Random Forests, Adaptive Boosting, XGBoost, Gaussian Naive Bayes, LightGBM, and CatBoost.

3. **Natural Language Processing (NLP)**:
   - Utilization of NLP techniques to analyze customer review texts, extracting sentiments and correlating them with overall satisfaction.

4. **Customer Segmentation**:
   - Application of RFM (Recency, Frequency, Monetary) Analysis and K-means clustering to categorize customers into distinct segments based on their purchasing behavior.

5. **Interactive GUI**:
   - A user-friendly Streamlit-based graphical user interface (GUI) is included, enabling users to interactively explore customer segments and insights derived from the models.

## Contents

1. **Jupyter Notebook**:
   - `Customer_Segmentation.ipynb`: This notebook contains the entire analysis workflow, from data preprocessing to model training and evaluation.

2. **GUI Application**:
   - `gui/`
     - `GUI.py`: A Python script built using Streamlit to provide an interactive user interface for exploring the results.
     - `Clustering_Sample.csv`: Sample data used within the GUI for demonstrating clustering techniques.
     - `EDA.csv`: Dataset utilized in exploratory data analysis, showcased in the GUI.

3. **Pre-trained Models**:
   - `Brazilian_Ecommerce_Classification.pkl`: Pre-trained classification model based on customer reviews.
   - `Brazilian_Ecommerce_Clustering.pkl`: Pre-trained clustering model for segmenting customers.

4. **Requirements**:
   - `requirements.txt`: This file contains a list of Python dependencies required to run the project seamlessly.
